MEMU
====

## My own EMUlatior for x86 platform
Inspired by ICS experiment in NJU
Thanks yzh and jyy

## MEMU will do:
* provide a very simple debugger interface
* support a subset of x86 instruction set
* support memory management (virtual memory, page, etc)
* support some of hardware interrupt

## Still Buggy
MEMU is still building and is quite buggy.
Bug that already know:
* Overflow flag is not set in a right way when doing arithmetic instructions

MEMU is just an extension of an experiment course.
Thanks yzh for the main frame of the MEMU.
